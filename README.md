# HR_data_analysis

Scope of the project: 
---------------------
What are the major factors related to the high attrition rate in the organization. So those KPIs need to be used and how I can work with those KPIs to help me create better story.
>In order to execute this, first I started by creating a Pivot table in an MS worksheet.
>Since we need to work on the attrition part, I need to have relevant columns for my analysis. So I start by first adding 'count of employees' column in value filed, and 'gender' column in rows field to check the employee count on the basis of gender. We also can show employee count on the basis of age group. We can analyse the data with the help of Pivot chart. With this we find that the age, count of empid and legend displays us the age gp from 24-34 leaves the company to switch, so this needs to be considered.
>No we try to replace the 'age' column with different other columns like 'business travel/department/education' to check for KPIs in our pivot graph that draws better insight.
>Performed Data cleaning & processing using Power BI.
>Prepared an extensive report using Power BI.

Analysis report findings:
-------------------------
>Identified key factors to reduce attrition.
>Improved hiring process.
